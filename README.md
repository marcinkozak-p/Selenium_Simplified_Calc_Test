Hello!

This is a simple test automation project for the calculator on this page:
https://testpages.herokuapp.com/calculate.php

To be able to see the run reports configure the following environment variable must be set in the run configuration:
CUCUMBER_PUBLISH_TOKEN=a0c9d7d6-65e5-4833-a7fc-e1ee28d5d264 

The run reports can be seen here:
https://reports.cucumber.io/report-collections/9bdbf8f3-a5b7-4b04-93db-addb96117c6e

The project contains a single test runner & cucumber feature file, either can be used to run the tests & generate reports
(given that the token is configured as described above)
